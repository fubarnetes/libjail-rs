# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Added

* implementations for `TryFrom` to start / stop jails.
* example showing how to query RCTL usage.
* code coverage with codecov.io. Unfortunately, this doesn't yet take docstests
  into account, so coverage is actually a bit better in reality.
* serialization support for stopped jails with serde (#53)

### Changed

* Published `RunningJails` as `RunningJailIter`
* `RunningJail::from_jid(...)` now returns an `Option<RunningJail>` depending on
  whether a Jail exists with that JID. The old behaviour of
  `RunningJail::from_jid(...)` can be found in
  `RunningJail::from_jid_unchecked(...)`
* Added debug logging using the `log` crate.

### Bugfixes
* Increased `type_length_limit` to 17825821 to fix a build failure on
  Rust 1.35.0 (See #59, #60, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58952).
* `RunningJails::params()` now correctly fails when an error occurs while
  reading parameters.

### Changed

* `RunningJail::save` now no longer saves the `vnet` parameter if it is set to
